THIS IS A TEST
I MADE THIS FROM ANOTHER SCRIPT I FOUND ON GITHUB
I IMPROVED SO IT WOULD BE USERFRIENDLY WITH HELP OF CHATGPT





# DDoS Tool

it's actually a simuate tool, like ddos option does not effectively work.

## Description
This DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) tool is a Python script that allows users to perform either a simple DoS attack (`dos`) or a distributed DoS attack (`ddos`).
The tool uses socket connections to flood the target server with resource-intensive requests, causing a denial of service.

![DDoS Tool Icon](ddos_icon.ico)

When you specify multiple IP addresses in the DDoS option, each IP address represents a different machine that will contribute to the attack.
These machines are often compromised computers or servers controlled by the attacker, forming a "botnet."
By coordinating the attack from various sources, the attacker can amplify the impact and make it more challenging for the target to mitigate the attack.

In the context of the provided Python script, the ability to add multiple IP addresses is a way to simulate a DDoS attack.
Each IP address you add corresponds to a different "attacker" machine.
The script then launches simultaneous attack threads from each of these IP addresses, creating a distributed effect.

## Features
- User-friendly GUI for input parameters using Tkinter.
- Support for both DoS and DDoS attacks.
- Customizable attack parameters: target IP or domain, target port, attack duration.
- Ability to add multiple IP addresses for DDoS attacks.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `tkinter`, `PIL` (Pillow)

## Usage
1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install tk pillow
Run the DDoS tool:

bash

python3 hammerV3_1.py
In the GUI, select the attack type (dos or ddos), enter the target IP or domain, target port, and attack duration.

For DDoS attacks, you can add multiple IP addresses by clicking the "Add IP" button. Remove IPs using the "Remove IP" button.

Click the "Launch Attack" button to initiate the DDoS attack.

USE:

1) Launching Threads: The ddos function in the script takes a list of target IP addresses (target_list) along with the target port and attack duration.
For each target IP address in the list, a new thread (dos function) is created.

2) Individual Attack Thread (dos function): The dos function represents an individual attack thread.
It connects to the specified target IP address and port and sends a resource-intensive request. This is done in a loop until the attack duration expires.

3) Sending Resource-Intensive Request (down_it function): The down_it function creates a socket connection to the target and sends a POST request with a large payload (resource-intensive).
This request is designed to consume server resources and potentially cause it to become unresponsive.

4) User Agent: The script includes a list of user agents (uagent), and each request is sent with a randomly selected user agent.
This simulates requests coming from different types of browsers or clients.
